  2. __Why We Chose__
    * Jest is a widely adopted testing framework used for testing React applications. It acts as a test runner, assertion library, mocking library, and comes bundled with Create-React-App for ease of use. It serves as an excellent test-runner which Enzyme utilizes to assert, manipulate, and traverse a React Componentsâ€™ output. Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to render a component (or multiple components), find elements, and interact with elements during testing. Its primary purpose when used alongside Jest is to provide additional functionality.
