Problem we sought to solve:
- As an Instagram user, I don't have an easy way to display all the locations I have been in a visual & interactive way. I would like a system in which I can see my photos on a map, know how many photos I've taken in places, and be able to see/view my photos at location in a group or individually. I would also like to be able to quickly search by location.


### Key Features

-    Utilize Instagram API to login through Instagram
-    Give user the ability to set account to private within profile settings
-    After login through Passport, pull data from Instagram and show:

    * Map marker of where photo was taken
    * Photo itself
    * Instagram photo caption, number of likes, and hashtags
    * User's Instagram username & avatar
    * Date photo was uploaded to Instagram

### API Integrations

- MapBox
- Instagram API
- Passport JS

### Back-end

- SQLite3 in development
- PostgreSQL on Heroku platform deployment

### Front-end

- React / Hooks
- Redux / Hooks

### Styling Considerations

- SCSS


## Tech Stack


### Front end (https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/geograpics-fe) built using:

- React / Hooks
- Redux / Hooks

#### Why did you choose this framework?

- Familiarity with the technology
- Scalability potential with Redux/thunk

### Styling Considerations

- SCSS

#### Why did you choose this framework?

- To make styling consistent across all developer repos

#### Front end deployed to Netlify

### Back end (https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/geograpics-be) built using the following:

- NodeJS
- Express
- Knex
- SQLite3 + PostgreSQL

#### Why did you choose this framework?

- Familiarity with the technology
- Most of it is industry standard or within the top choices when designing a new system

### How do you plan on interacting with your APIs?

- REST API

#### Back end deployed to Heroku using PostgreSQL plugin


# APIs

##  Authentication API:

### PassportJS + Instagram API

We used Passport JS tokens, along with Instagram API for user authentication.  Passport JS supports both cookies and tokens, enabling customization.  The directions are relatively straight-forward, and the programmers already ensured its compatibility with Instagram's API.  Combined, it leaves security to far more qualified developers, allowing the Geograpics team to focus more on a seamless integration of user registration, login, and app use.

##  Map + Marker Rendering API:

### MapBox API

We used Mapbox API to render the map and markers.  It's a competitor to Google Maps, though with much cheaper developer usage plans, fewer API calls, a more seamless integration into our tech stack, and a generally smoother implementation than what Google Maps allows for.


# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables on Heroku. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    * PORT - the desired local port
    * CALLBACKURL - where Passport JS redirects to.  The initial endpoint is yoursite.com/auth/instagram, the Callback URL is yoursite.com/auth/instagram/callback, or localhost: ###
    * DB_ENV - for the database config file
    * FRONTENDURL - yourHostingSite.com
    * INSTACLIENT - a secret string for Instagram verification, obtained from Instagram
    * INSTASECRET - a secret string for Instagram verification, obtained from Instagram
    * TOKENSECRET - any variable you choose, the secret for the token encryption that Passport JS uses

# Content Licenses

All photos used on Geograpics or in design files are royalty-free & attribution-free, requiring no licenses.  All headshots of developers are the property of their respective persons, no license, explicit or implied, is granted for use outside this readme file without the express permission of the owner/person in the headshot image.

# Testing

### What We Chose

- Jest, Enzyme, and Cypress

### Why We Chose

- Jest is a widely adopted testing framework used for testing React applications. It acts as a test runner, assertion library, mocking library, and comes bundled with Create-React-App for ease of use. It serves as an excellent test-runner which Enzyme utilizes to assert, manipulate, and traverse a React Components’ output. Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to render a component (or multiple components), find elements, and interact with elements during testing. Its primary purpose when used in addition to Jest is to provide additional functionality.

- Cypress is a next-gen front end testing tool, makes it simple to set up and write tests, run the tests, and debug. Enables you to write faster, more reliable, and easier tests. Cypress takes screen caps as your tests run, tells you exactly what is causing your bugs, and is nearly instantaneous. It's a browser based testing like Selenium except it doesn't require any dependencies and is much easier to set up

# Installation Instructions

- Dependencies are listed in package.json and can be installed locally using:
    - "yarn install" can be used to install the required dependencies from the package.json on front end
    - "npm install" can be used to install the required dependencies from the package.json on back end; recommend installing nodemon as well for local dev dependencies


## Other Scripts

    * npm run server - used to start local server using nodemon, "nodemon index.js"
    * npm run start - used to start Heroku deployment, "node index.js"
    * yarn run test - used to start front end testing

 - Check to see if the issue has recently been fixed by attempting to reproduce the issue using the latest master branch in the repository.
 - Create a live example of the problem.
 - Submit a detailed bug report including your environment & browser, steps to reproduce the issue, actual and expected outcomes,  where you believe the issue is originating from, and any potential solutions you have considered.

### Feature Requests

We would love to hear from you about new features which would improve this app and further the aims of our project. Please provide as much detail and information as possible to show us why you think your new feature should be implemented.

### Pull Requests

If you have developed a patch, bug fix, or new feature that would improve this app, please submit a pull request. It is best to communicate your ideas with the developers first before investing a great deal of time into a pull request to ensure that it will mesh smoothly with the project.

Remember that this project is licensed under the MIT license, and by submitting a pull request, you agree that your work will be, too.

#### Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new plist variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
- Ensure that your code conforms to our existing code conventions and test coverage.
- Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
